O_thread -> Android : SYNC(1, seq)

note right Android
Android will store received "seq" 
when create a connection,
but this "seq" will share between multi connection.
When Android receive a SYNC msg, 
it will response a SYNC msg with its stored "seq".
So if multi AdbHost connect to Android, 
this "seq" will not match,
this is why AdbHost could become "Offline"  
end note

note over O_thread
AdbHost will share "seq" 
between O_thread and I_thread
end note

Android -> I_thread : SYNC(1, _seq)

note over I_thread
If "_seq" match "seq", 
AdbHost can send 
command to Android.
end note

I_thread -> Android: Command

note over I_thread
If "_seq" not match "seq",
Adb Host become offline
end note

I_thread -> Android: SYNC(0, 0)
